# Auto-SBM Code Quality Improvement Initiative - PRD

## Executive Summary

Transform the auto-sbm codebase from functional prototype to production-grade software by systematically addressing 936 code quality issues, implementing comprehensive type safety, and achieving 80%+ test coverage. This initiative will reduce maintenance burden, improve developer experience, and establish the foundation for reliable long-term development.

## Problem & Solution

### Problem Statement

The auto-sbm tool successfully performs SCSS migrations but suffers from critical technical debt:
- **936 ruff linting errors** causing maintenance friction
- **469 type annotation issues** preventing reliable type checking
- **~39% test coverage** (12 tests for 31 source files) creating deployment risk
- **Documentation-reality gap** confusing new developers
- **121 print statements** in production code hindering debugging

### Solution Overview

Implement a phased quality improvement program using industry-standard tools (Ruff, MyPy, pytest-cov) with strategic prioritization based on risk and impact. Transform the codebase while maintaining feature stability through comprehensive validation loops.

## Implementation Blueprint

### Data Models & Structure

Current structure uses inline models and basic configuration. Target structure implements comprehensive type safety:

```python
# Current: Basic configuration
class Config:
    def get_setting(self, key: str, default=None):
        return self._settings.get(key, default)

# Target: Pydantic v2 with full validation
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, field_validator
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings

class MigrationSettings(BaseModel):
    cleanup_snapshots: bool = Field(default=True)
    create_backups: bool = Field(default=True)
    max_concurrent_files: int = Field(default=10, ge=1, le=50)
    
    @field_validator('max_concurrent_files')
    @classmethod
    def validate_concurrency(cls, v: int) -> int:
        if v > 50:
            raise ValueError('Too many concurrent files')
        return v

### Integration Points

```yaml
CI/CD Pipeline:
  pre-commit:
    - "ruff check . --fix"
    - "mypy sbm/"
    - "pytest tests/ --cov=sbm --cov-fail-under=80"
  
  GitHub Actions:
    - add: .github/workflows/quality.yml
    - checks: [linting, type-checking, tests, coverage]
    - gates: All checks must pass

Configuration:
  pyproject.toml:
    - update: tool.pytest.ini_options coverage threshold
    - add: tool.coverage.report exclude_lines
    - ensure: mypy strict mode configuration

Development Workflow:
  pre-commit hooks:
    - ruff check --fix
    - mypy check
    - pytest with coverage
```

## Validation Loop

### Level 1: Environment & Syntax

```bash
# Critical: Run FIRST before any code changes
python -c "import pydantic, mypy, pytest; print('Environment OK')"
ruff check sbm/ --fix  # Auto-fix what's possible
mypy sbm/              # Must pass with zero errors

# Expected: Clean environment, no import errors
```

### Level 2: Incremental Quality Gates

```bash
# After each task completion:
ruff check sbm/ --statistics  # Track error reduction
mypy sbm/ --report .mypy_cache/  # Track type coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=sbm --cov-report=term-missing  # Track test coverage

# Success Criteria per Phase:
# Phase 1: Environment setup works, critical imports resolved
# Phase 2: Ruff errors <500, MyPy errors <100, Coverage >50%
# Phase 3: Ruff errors <100, MyPy clean, Coverage >80%
```

### Level 3: Functional Validation

```bash
# Integration test - actual migration workflow
cd ~/di-websites-platform
sbm migrate test-theme --skip-post-migration

# Expected: Migration completes without errors
# Logs: Clear, informative, no debugging prints
# Files: Generated correctly with proper formatting
```

### Level 4: Quality Metrics

```bash
# Comprehensive quality assessment
pytest tests/ -v --cov=sbm --cov-report=html
ruff check . --statistics > quality_metrics.txt
mypy sbm/ --html-report .mypy_cache/html

# Review generated reports for:
# - Test coverage gaps
# - Remaining code quality issues
# - Type safety completeness
```
