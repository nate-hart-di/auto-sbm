IDK please advise. but it needs to update based on type of fix. eg bugfix + 0.01 regular patch/new feature + 0.1 and\n  major upgrade - go up to next whole number eg n.x.x --> (n+1).0.0. There also needs to be a changelog for each of the versions, i'd like this to be constructed retroactively for at least all changes since 2.0.0 happened and version numbers created as well as changelog that\n  can be retrieved via sbm version (somthing)\n  sbm update returns confusing and incorrect info\n  ~ sbm update\n  🔄 Updating auto-sbm...\n  📥 Pulling latest changes from origin/master...\n  ✅ Already up to date.\n\n\n  ✅ Update complete! Run 'sbm --version' to verify.\n\n\n  1. it ALWAYS says already up to date but it needs to actually say what updated. its actually updating a lot in the above command but doesnt appear that way.\n  2. update complete sbm --version is NOT correct. it's actually \"sbm version\"\n\n  that's just getting started too. Let's please plan a cli improvement. please don't massively overengineer it just focus on highest impact changes + my requests first pass. we can always iterate."}
